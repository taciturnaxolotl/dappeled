## What's this?

It's the app I made because I was mad. More specifically its a website to move your spotify playlists and liked songs to apple music 100% free and self hostable.

## Why AGPL 3.0?

I want to realllllly make sure that this code stays free in all forms. One common misconception here though is that you can't download and run software licensed under the AGPL 3.0 without making your source code public. This is not true. You can run the software on your own server without making your source code public. <img src="https://cachet.dunkirk.sh/emojis/kitty-gun/r" align="right" /> The AGPL 3.0 only requires you to make your source code public if you are distributing the software to others (e.g. selling it, or making it available for download). If you are running the software on your own server for you and some friends or if you are running it unmodified for your company, you do not have to make your source code public. Just don't ever charge for this software. Ever.
